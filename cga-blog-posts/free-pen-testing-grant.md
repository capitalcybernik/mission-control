# Free Penetration Testing for Small Businesses: How to Apply for the CGA $5,000 Grant

A single data breach can cost a small business six figures or more — yet the one test that can tell you whether you're vulnerable typically starts at $5,000. For most small businesses, that's money that goes to payroll, inventory, or keeping the lights on.

That's the gap the **Cyber Grants Alliance (CGA) Penetration Testing Grant** was designed to close. Sponsored by [Capital Cyber Compliance](https://capital-cyber.com), the grant covers the full cost of a professional penetration test — $5,000 in value — at no charge to qualifying businesses.

Here's what the grant includes, who qualifies, and how to apply.

## What a Penetration Test Actually Does

Think of it as a security stress test. A team of certified professionals tries to break into your systems the same way a real attacker would — except they do it with your permission and hand you a detailed report afterward.

The goal is to answer one question: **If a cybercriminal targeted your business today, could they get in?**

A typical engagement moves through several phases:

**Reconnaissance.** The team gathers publicly available information about your business — your website, email systems, network footprint — the same research a real attacker would do first.

**Scanning.** Specialized tools probe your network for known weaknesses: outdated software, misconfigured firewalls, weak credentials, exposed ports.

**Exploitation testing.** This is where the team actually tries to use those weaknesses to gain access, escalate privileges, and move through your environment — simulating a real attack chain.

**Reporting and remediation guidance.** You receive an executive summary in plain language explaining every finding, its severity, and a prioritized list of steps to fix it. This isn't just a list of problems — it's a roadmap.

## Why This Matters Right Now

Small businesses have never been more squarely in attackers' crosshairs. The FBI's [Operation Winter SHIELD](https://www.fbi.gov/wintershield), launched in early 2026, is a nationwide campaign urging businesses of all sizes to take concrete steps to strengthen their cyber defenses. The initiative highlights that the vast majority of breaches exploit a small set of common security gaps — exactly the kind of gaps a penetration test is designed to uncover.

At the same time, compliance requirements are tightening across industries. HIPAA, the FTC Safeguards Rule, and CMMC all expect organizations to actively test their security controls. A penetration test is often the most direct way to demonstrate you're meeting those requirements.

And the cost of doing nothing keeps rising. Ransomware attacks against small businesses have surged, and attackers increasingly target organizations they know lack dedicated security teams. A breach doesn't just mean downtime — it means forensic costs, legal fees, regulatory fines, customer notification, and reputational damage that compounds over months.

## Why Businesses Skip Pen Testing (and Why They Shouldn't)

Most small businesses that skip penetration testing don't do so because they think security doesn't matter. They skip it because of cost.

A quality pen test requires highly skilled professionals using a combination of automated tools and manual techniques — that expertise isn't cheap, with most firms charging $5,000 to $15,000 depending on network complexity.

That calculus changes when the test is free. This grant removes the financial barrier entirely, giving your business access to the same caliber of assessment that larger organizations budget for annually.
