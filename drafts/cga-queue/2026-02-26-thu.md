Did you know? Most small businesses hit by a cyberattack close within 6 months.

That's not a scare tactic — it's a wake-up call.

The problem isn't awareness. Most small business owners KNOW cybersecurity matters. The problem is cost. A single penetration test can run $5,000–$15,000. For a 10-person shop or a local nonprofit, that's simply out of reach.

That's exactly why Cyber Grants Alliance exists.

We provide FREE penetration testing grants to small businesses and nonprofits that can't afford cybersecurity assessments. No strings attached. Just protection.

Because keeping our communities safe online shouldn't depend on the size of your budget.
