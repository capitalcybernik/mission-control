<h1>CMMC Compliance for Manufacturers</h1>
<p>Navy NAVSEA, DLA, and Air Force contracts already require CMMC certification. If you make parts for the Department of Defense, compliance is no longer optional.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<div class="container">
<h2>Navy NAVSEA and DLA Are Setting the Pace</h2>
<p>The manufacturing sector is seeing CMMC requirements spread rapidly through two primary channels: Navy NAVSEA contracts for ship and submarine systems, and Defense Logistics Agency solicitations for parts and components. Together, these agencies account for the majority of CMMC manufacturing solicitations currently posted on SAM.gov.</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="t">IDIQ MAC Submarine CNO Availabilities</p>
<p>Navy NAVSEA. Level 2 C3PAO required. This contract covers submarine maintenance, and every manufacturer in the supply chain needs third party certification.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p class="t">Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) Legacy</p>
<p>Navy NAVSEA. Level 2 required. Defense electronics and systems integration work that flows down to component manufacturers.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p class="t">31-Multiple (DLA Aviation Parts)</p>
<p>DLA Aviation. Level 2 self assessment. Replacement parts for military aircraft. If you supply DLA, expect CMMC to be standard language in every future solicitation.</p>
</div>

<p>Air Force Materiel Command and Air Force Space Command are also active, with contracts covering everything from gearbox assemblies to space domain awareness systems. The trend is clear: CMMC is becoming a standard requirement across all defense manufacturing procurement.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<div class="container">
<h2>The Supply Chain Effect</h2>
<p>Manufacturing contracts have a unique characteristic that amplifies the impact of CMMC: deep supply chains. A single prime contract for submarine maintenance can involve dozens of subcontractors, each providing specialized components, coatings, machining, electronics, or assembly services.</p>
<p>When the prime contract requires Level 2 C3PAO certification, that requirement flows down to every subcontractor handling controlled unclassified information. Your prime contractor will ask for proof of CMMC certification not as a suggestion, but as a condition of doing business. If you cannot provide it, they will find a supplier who can.</p>
<p>This is already happening. Manufacturers who have been supplying the same primes for decades are being told: get certified or get replaced. The contracts on SAM.gov are the visible tip. The supply chain flow down is the wave underneath.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<div class="container">
<h2>Manufacturing Specific Challenges</h2>
<p>Manufacturers face cybersecurity challenges that office based businesses do not encounter. CMMC assessors understand these environments, but you need to be prepared to address them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shop floor systems.</strong> CNC machines, PLCs, and industrial controllers often run legacy operating systems that cannot be patched in the traditional sense. You need a documented strategy for protecting these systems, whether through network segmentation, compensating controls, or upgrade plans.</li>
<li><strong>IoT and connected devices.</strong> Temperature sensors, quality inspection cameras, automated material handling systems: all of these create network entry points. Each one needs to be inventoried and secured.</li>
<li><strong>CUI on the production floor.</strong> Technical drawings, specifications, and work orders that contain CUI are often printed and posted at workstations. Controlling access to this information in a manufacturing environment requires different approaches than a typical office.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access.</strong> Equipment vendors often need remote access for maintenance and troubleshooting. Every remote connection is a potential vulnerability that needs to be managed with MFA, logging, and access controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>These challenges are real, but they are solvable. Capital Cyber works with manufacturers to build compliance programs that account for the realities of production environments.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>The Big 5 Controls You Need</h2>
<p>The foundation of CMMC compliance for manufacturers starts with five core controls:</p>

<div class="controls-grid">
<div class="control">
<h4>Multi Factor Authentication</h4>
<p>Every account accessing company systems, from email to ERP to CAD, needs a second factor. This is non negotiable for Level 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="control">
<h4>Endpoint Detection &amp; Response</h4>
<p>EDR on every workstation, laptop, and server. This goes beyond antivirus to actively monitor for and respond to threats in real time.</p>
</div>
<div class="control">
<h4>Encrypted Backups</h4>
<p>Production data, CAD files, customer specifications, and business systems all need encrypted, offsite backups that are tested regularly.</p>
</div>
<div class="control">
<h4>Security Awareness Training</h4>
<p>From front office to shop floor, every employee who touches a computer or handles CUI needs documented, recurring security training.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="controls-grid" style="grid-template-columns:1fr">
<div class="control">
<h4>Automated Patching</h4>
<p>Workstations, servers, and applications need automated updates. For shop floor systems that cannot be patched, document compensating controls.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>How Capital Cyber Helps Manufacturers</h2>
<p>Capital Cyber's Fast Track program is built for the pace manufacturers operate at. You have production schedules to meet and cannot afford weeks of downtime for a cybersecurity overhaul. Our approach is designed around that reality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>30 day implementation</strong> of the Big 5 controls, scheduled around your production needs</li>
<li><strong>Fixed fee pricing</strong> so you know the cost before we start</li>
<li><strong>Shop floor assessment</strong> that accounts for CNC machines, industrial controllers, and IoT devices</li>
<li><strong>Documentation package</strong> including your System Security Plan, network diagrams, and POA&amp;M</li>
<li><strong>Assessment preparation</strong> for self assessment or C3PAO audit</li>
</ul>
<p>We have worked with machine shops, electronics manufacturers, defense subcontractors, and assembly operations across the country. We understand that compliance needs to fit around production, not the other way around.</p>

<div class="grant-box">
<p><strong>Cybersecurity Grants Available.</strong> Capital Cyber sponsors cybersecurity grants through the Cyber Grants Alliance. Eligible businesses may qualify for a free assessment. <a href="https://capital-cyber.com/rick">Talk to us to find out if you qualify.</a></p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>We're a subcontractor. Do we still need CMMC?</h3>
<p>Yes. If you handle CUI as part of a DoD supply chain, you need CMMC certification at the level required by the prime contract. Primes are required to flow down CMMC requirements to all subcontractors handling CUI.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What level do manufacturing contracts typically require?</h3>
<p>Most current solicitations require Level 2. Some allow self assessment, while others (particularly Navy NAVSEA contracts) require C3PAO third party certification. Level 1 is less common and generally applies to contracts with limited CUI exposure.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What about our CNC machines and shop floor systems?</h3>
<p>Legacy industrial systems are a known challenge in CMMC compliance. The key is network segmentation (isolating shop floor systems from your business network), documenting compensating controls for systems that cannot be patched, and ensuring CUI is protected at every point in your workflow. Capital Cyber has specific experience with manufacturing environments.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How long does compliance take for a manufacturer?</h3>
<p>The Big 5 controls go in within 30 days through our Fast Track program. Full assessment readiness typically takes 60 to 90 days depending on the complexity of your environment, particularly if you have extensive shop floor systems that need segmentation or compensating controls.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>Capital Cyber offers fixed fee pricing. The cost depends on the number of users, locations, and the complexity of your manufacturing environment. <a href="https://capital-cyber.com/rick">Schedule a call</a> and we will provide a clear quote with no hidden fees.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Will compliance disrupt our production?</h3>
<p>No. We schedule implementation around your production calendar. The Big 5 controls can be deployed with minimal disruption, and we coordinate any network changes for off hours or planned maintenance windows.</p>
