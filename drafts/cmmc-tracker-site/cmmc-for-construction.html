<h1>CMMC Compliance for Construction Companies</h1>
<p>The Army Corps of Engineers is already requiring CMMC certification on active solicitations. If you build for the federal government, this is your new reality.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<div class="container">
<h2>Army Corps of Engineers Is Leading the Charge</h2>
<p>USACE is the single largest source of CMMC requirements in the construction sector. Of the 15 construction solicitations we track that require CMMC, 13 come from the Army Corps of Engineers. These cover everything from design build contracts to microgrid installations to seismic upgrades.</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="t">USACE NWD Design Build MATOC</p>
<p>Level 2 C3PAO required. Multi award task order contract for design build work across the Northwestern Division. Posted February 2026.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p class="t">Special Tactics Complex, OR Air National Guard</p>
<p>Level 2 C3PAO required. Military construction for special operations. This is not an IT project. It is a building, and it requires cybersecurity certification.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p class="t">Ft. Buchanan Microgrid</p>
<p>Level 2 required. Energy infrastructure at a military installation. Even electrical and mechanical contractors are now in scope for CMMC.</p>
</div>

<p>The pattern is clear. USACE is embedding CMMC into contracts that, two years ago, had zero cybersecurity language. If you are a general contractor, specialty contractor, or design build firm that works on military installations, CMMC certification is no longer optional.</p>
</div>
</section>

<div class="container">
<h2>What CMMC Means for Your Construction Business</h2>
<p>The practical impact is straightforward: without CMMC certification, you cannot bid on these contracts. Your proposal will be rejected before it is evaluated on merit. This applies to prime contractors and subcontractors alike.</p>
<p>If you are a subcontractor on a CMMC contract, the prime is required to flow down the certification requirement to you. Even if you never interact with the contracting officer directly, you will need to demonstrate compliance. Primes are already asking their subs about CMMC status because their own certification depends on it.</p>
<p>This also affects your competitive position. As more contracts require certification, the pool of eligible bidders shrinks. Companies that get certified early will face less competition on these contracts. Companies that wait will find themselves locked out of work they used to win routinely.</p>
</div>

<h2>The Big 5 Controls You Need</h2>
<p>CMMC Level 2 maps to 110 controls from NIST SP 800-171. That sounds overwhelming, but the foundation comes down to five areas where most construction companies have the biggest gaps:</p>

<div class="controls-grid">
<div class="control">
<h4>Multi Factor Authentication</h4>
<p>Every account that accesses company systems needs a second factor beyond a password. This includes email, file sharing, project management tools, and remote access.</p>
</div>
<div class="control">
<h4>Endpoint Detection &amp; Response</h4>
<p>Traditional antivirus is not enough. EDR monitors every device for suspicious activity and can isolate threats before they spread across your network.</p>
</div>
<div class="control">
<h4>Encrypted Backups</h4>
<p>Your data needs to be backed up, encrypted, stored offsite, and tested regularly. If ransomware hits, you need to be able to restore operations without paying.</p>
</div>
<div class="control">
<h4>Security Awareness Training</h4>
<p>Every employee needs documented, recurring training on phishing, password security, and data handling. Annual training is the minimum. Quarterly is better.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="controls-grid" style="grid-template-columns:1fr">
<div class="control">
<h4>Automated Patching</h4>
<p>Software vulnerabilities are discovered constantly. Automated patching ensures your systems are updated without waiting for someone to remember to do it manually.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These five controls won't get you to full Level 2 compliance on their own, but they close the most critical gaps and build the foundation that everything else rests on.</p>

<h2>How Capital Cyber Helps Construction Companies</h2>
<p>Capital Cyber's Fast Track program was designed for businesses like yours. You don't have an IT department with cybersecurity expertise. You have projects to run, bids to submit, and deadlines to hit. You need compliance without disruption.</p>
<p>Here is what Fast Track delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>30 day implementation</strong> of the Big 5 controls</li>
<li><strong>Fixed fee pricing</strong> with no surprise invoices or scope creep</li>
<li><strong>Documentation package</strong> including your System Security Plan (SSP) and Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M)</li>
<li><strong>Assessment preparation</strong> so you know exactly what to expect from a self assessment or C3PAO audit</li>
</ul>
<p>We work with construction companies across the country, from regional general contractors to national specialty firms. We understand that your priority is winning and executing contracts, not becoming cybersecurity experts. That is our job.</p>

<div class="grant-box">
<p><strong>Cybersecurity Grants Available.</strong> Capital Cyber sponsors cybersecurity grants through the Cyber Grants Alliance. Eligible businesses may qualify for a free assessment. <a href="https://capital-cyber.com/rick">Talk to us to find out if you qualify.</a></p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do subcontractors need CMMC certification?</h3>
<p>Yes. If you handle controlled unclassified information (CUI) as a subcontractor on a DoD contract, you need CMMC certification at the level specified in the contract. Primes are required to flow this down.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What level do most construction contracts require?</h3>
<p>The majority of current solicitations require Level 2. Some start at Level 1 with escalation clauses that move to Level 2 and Level 3 over time. A small number of high sensitivity projects require Level 2 with a C3PAO (third party) assessment from the start.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How long does it take to get CMMC certified?</h3>
<p>Capital Cyber's Fast Track program implements the foundational controls in 30 days. Full certification readiness depends on your starting point, but most construction companies can be assessment ready within 60 to 90 days.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How much does CMMC compliance cost?</h3>
<p>Capital Cyber offers fixed fee pricing for the Fast Track program. The exact cost depends on the size of your organization and the scope of systems that handle CUI. <a href="https://capital-cyber.com/rick">Schedule a call</a> and we will give you a clear number.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>We don't handle classified information. Do we still need CMMC?</h3>
<p>CMMC is not about classified information. It covers controlled unclassified information (CUI), which includes things like building plans for military facilities, project schedules, contract details, and technical specifications. If you work on a DoD construction project, you almost certainly handle CUI.</p>
