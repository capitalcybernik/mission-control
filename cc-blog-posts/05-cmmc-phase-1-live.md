# CMMC Phase 1 Is Live: What Defense Contractors Need to Do Right Now

**Meta Description:** CMMC enforcement has begun. Here's what Phase 1 means for defense contractors, which contracts are affected, and the steps to take immediately.

---

The wait is over. CMMC Phase 1 enforcement is active, and the Department of Defense is including CMMC requirements in new contracts. If you're a defense contractor who's been treating compliance as a "next quarter" problem, that quarter has arrived.

This isn't a drill, and it's not another postponement. The 48 CFR rule is final. Contracts are being issued with CMMC clauses today. The question is no longer whether you need to comply, but whether you can demonstrate compliance before your next contract action.

## What Phase 1 Actually Means

Phase 1 of the CMMC rollout introduces certification requirements into select DoD contracts. During this phase:

**CMMC Level 1 (Self-Assessment)** applies to contracts involving Federal Contract Information (FCI). Contractors must complete a self-assessment against 17 basic practices from FAR 52.204-21 and submit the results.

**CMMC Level 2 (Third-Party Assessment)** applies to contracts involving [CUI](https://capital-cyber.com/cui-the-hot-potato-of-government-data/). Most contractors handling CUI will need independent verification by a C3PAO. Some contracts may allow self-assessment for Level 2, but the trend is clearly toward third-party validation.

**CMMC Level 3 (Government-Led Assessment)** applies to contracts involving the most sensitive programs. Government assessors evaluate compliance with NIST 800-172 enhanced controls.

The DoD is ramping up gradually, but "gradually" still means contracts are being affected right now. Waiting for your specific contract to include the clause before starting preparation is a recipe for lost revenue.

## The Timeline Problem

Here's what most contractors don't account for: the time between "we need CMMC" and "we have CMMC" is measured in months, not weeks.

**Gap assessment:** 2–4 weeks
**Remediation planning and execution:** 3–12 months (depending on gaps)
**Documentation and evidence building:** Ongoing, minimum 3 months of operational evidence preferred
**C3PAO assessment scheduling:** Current wait times of 2–4 months
**Assessment itself:** 1–2 weeks
**POA&M remediation (if needed):** Up to 180 days

From a standing start, you're looking at 6 to 18 months before you hold a CMMC Level 2 certification. If a contract requires it at renewal or recompete and you haven't started, you're mathematically out of time.

## Steps to Take This Week

### 1. Know Your Level

Determine which CMMC level your contracts require. Review your existing contracts and any upcoming solicitations. If you handle CUI in any form, assume Level 2.

If you're unsure whether your work involves CUI, that uncertainty is itself a risk. [Understanding CUI classifications](https://capital-cyber.com/cui-the-hot-potato-of-government-data/) and how they apply to your specific contracts is step one.

### 2. Get an Honest Assessment

If your [SPRS score](https://capital-cyber.com/capital-cyber-helping-with-sprs-score/) is based on a self-assessment you did more than six months ago, it's time for a fresh, independent evaluation. You need to know your actual compliance posture, not your aspirational one.

A qualified assessor will evaluate your environment against all 110 NIST 800-171 controls and give you a realistic score, a prioritized gap list, and a remediation roadmap with actual timelines.

### 3. Scope Your CUI Environment

Define exactly where CUI enters, lives, and exits your network. Every system in that path is in scope for CMMC assessment. Tighter scope means lower cost and faster compliance.

Consider [network segmentation](https://capital-cyber.com/compliance-culture-its-not-just-for-hr-anymore/) to isolate your CUI environment from general business systems. This is one of the highest-impact steps you can take to reduce assessment complexity.

### 4. Fix the Documentation

CMMC requires an SSP, POA&M, and a full library of [security policies and procedures](https://capital-cyber.com/cmmc-policies-the-boring-but-critical-docs-you-cant-ignore/). If these don't exist or haven't been updated, start now. Assessors weight documentation heavily, and building it from scratch takes longer than most contractors expect.

### 5. Address Your Supply Chain

If you flow CUI to subcontractors, their compliance is your responsibility. [DFARS flow-down requirements](https://capital-cyber.com/dfars-flow-down-the-compliance-headache-you-cant-ignore/) mean you need documented evidence that your subs are meeting the same standards. Start those conversations now, before they become assessment findings.

### 6. Budget for Ongoing Compliance

CMMC certification lasts three years, with annual affirmation requirements. This isn't a one-time cost. Build recurring compliance expenses into your [business operations](https://capital-cyber.com/process-that-can-make-or-break-your-business/) so certification renewal isn't a scramble.

## What Happens If You Don't Act

The consequences are straightforward and escalating:

**Contract ineligibility.** You cannot win new DoD contracts that include CMMC requirements without the appropriate certification level.

**Contract loss at recompete.** When existing contracts come up for renewal with CMMC clauses added, uncertified contractors are not eligible.

**Supply chain exclusion.** Prime contractors are increasingly requiring CMMC compliance from their subcontractors. Even if your direct contract doesn't require it yet, your prime might.

**False Claims Act exposure.** If your submitted SPRS score doesn't match your actual compliance posture, there's legal risk beyond just losing contracts.

## The Competitive Angle

Every contractor who achieves CMMC certification while competitors are still scrambling gains a competitive advantage. Primes need certified subs. The DoD needs certified contractors. Being ready when others aren't means winning contracts they can't bid on.

The cost of compliance is real. The cost of being locked out of the defense market is larger.
