# CMMC vs. NIST 800-171: What's Actually Different and Why It Matters

**Meta Description:** CMMC and NIST 800-171 aren't the same thing. Here's what changed, what's new, and what defense contractors need to know about both frameworks.

---

If you're a defense contractor, you've been living with NIST 800-171 for years. Now CMMC is here, and the most common question is: aren't they the same thing?

Almost. But the differences are exactly where contractors get tripped up. Understanding what changed between "implement NIST 800-171 and self-attest" and "prove it to a third-party assessor" is the difference between a smooth transition and a six-figure surprise.

## The Short Version

NIST 800-171 defines the 110 security controls that protect CUI in non-federal systems. That hasn't changed. Those same 110 controls are the foundation of CMMC Level 2.

What changed is the verification model. Before CMMC, contractors self-assessed their compliance, submitted a [SPRS score](https://capital-cyber.com/capital-cyber-helping-with-sprs-score/), and that was largely the end of it. Nobody verified whether the self-assessment was accurate. The government took your word for it.

CMMC replaces trust with verification. For Level 2, most contractors handling CUI will need a C3PAO (Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization) to independently validate their compliance. Self-attestation is still available for some contracts, but the trajectory is clear: prove it or lose it.

## What Stays the Same

**The controls.** CMMC Level 2 maps directly to NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2. The 14 control families and 110 security requirements are identical. If you've genuinely implemented 800-171, you've done the technical work for CMMC Level 2.

**The scope.** Both frameworks apply to systems that process, store, or transmit [CUI](https://capital-cyber.com/cui-the-hot-potato-of-government-data/). Scoping your CUI boundary correctly matters just as much under CMMC as it did under NIST.

**DFARS requirements.** The [DFARS 252.204-7012 clause](https://capital-cyber.com/dfars-flow-down-the-compliance-headache-you-cant-ignore/) requiring NIST 800-171 implementation isn't going away. CMMC adds a certification layer on top of existing DFARS obligations.

## What's Actually Different

### Verification Is No Longer Self-Reported

This is the fundamental shift. Under the old model, a contractor could submit a SPRS score of 110 (perfect compliance) and nobody would check. Industry estimates suggest a significant percentage of self-reported scores are inflated, sometimes dramatically.

Under CMMC Level 2, a C3PAO assessor walks through your environment, reviews your documentation, examines evidence, and independently determines whether each control is met. The days of optimistic self-assessment are over.

### Three Certification Levels Replace a Single Standard

NIST 800-171 was binary: you either implemented it or you didn't (and many didn't). CMMC introduces three levels:

**Level 1 (Foundational):** 17 basic practices from FAR 52.204-21. Self-assessment permitted. For contractors handling Federal Contract Information (FCI) but not CUI.

**Level 2 (Advanced):** The full 110 NIST 800-171 controls. Third-party assessment required for most contracts involving CUI. Self-assessment permitted for some lower-risk contracts.

**Level 3 (Expert):** NIST 800-171 plus additional controls from NIST SP 800-172. Government-led assessment. For contractors on the most sensitive programs.

This tiered approach means contractors need to know exactly which level their contracts require, because over-preparing wastes money and under-preparing loses contracts.

### POA&Ms Have Limits

Under NIST 800-171, a Plan of Action and Milestones was an open-ended promise to fix things eventually. Some contractors maintained POA&Ms for years without actually completing remediation.

CMMC tightens this. While POA&Ms are still permitted for certain controls, there are limitations on which controls can remain in POA&M status during assessment, and there are defined timelines for closure. You can't carry critical gaps indefinitely.

### Certification Is Time-Bound

CMMC certification is valid for three years (for Level 2). After that, you reassess. This creates a recurring compliance cycle rather than a one-time effort, which means your security program needs to be sustainable, not just passable.

Annual affirmation requirements between assessments ensure contractors maintain their posture throughout the certification period.

## Where the Real Risk Lives

The contractors in the most danger are those who submitted high SPRS scores based on generous self-assessment and now face independent verification that will tell a very different story.

If your SPRS score says 90 but a real assessment would reveal 40, you have a gap that costs real money and real time to close. And with [CMMC Phase 1 live](https://capital-cyber.com/the-cmmc-express-is-leaving-the-station-are-you-on-it/), that clock is ticking.

The other at-risk group: contractors who implemented NIST 800-171 controls technically but never built the documentation and evidence trail CMMC assessors require. The controls might be in place, but without an SSP, policies, procedures, and operational evidence, you can't prove it. And under CMMC, proof is everything.

## The Strategic Approach

**If you've genuinely implemented NIST 800-171:** Your technical work is largely done. Focus on documentation, evidence collection, and assessment preparation. Close any POA&M items that have been lingering. Build the [policy library](https://capital-cyber.com/cmmc-policies-the-boring-but-critical-docs-you-cant-ignore/) your assessor will expect.

**If your SPRS score is aspirational:** Get an honest gap assessment now. Understand the real distance between where you are and where Level 2 requires you to be. Build a remediation plan with realistic timelines and budget.

**If you're not sure where you stand:** That uncertainty is itself the risk. A pre-assessment gives you the clarity to plan, budget, and execute with confidence.

## Know Where You Stand Before the Assessor Does

The worst time to discover a gap is during your C3PAO assessment. We help defense contractors evaluate their actual compliance posture against CMMC Level 2 requirements, identify the real gaps (not the theoretical ones), and build remediation plans that lead to successful certification.
