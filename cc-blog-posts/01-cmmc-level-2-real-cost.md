# CMMC Level 2: The Real Cost Breakdown for Small Defense Contractors

**Meta Description:** CMMC Level 2 compliance costs $75K–$200K+ for small contractors. Here's exactly where that money goes and how to budget without losing contracts.

---

Every defense contractor asking about CMMC eventually lands on the same question: how much is this going to cost me?

The honest answer is $75,000 to $200,000 or more for Level 2, depending on where you're starting and how much of your environment handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). That range is wide enough to be useless without context, so let's break down exactly where the money goes.

## The Five Cost Buckets

### 1. Gap Assessment: $15,000–$30,000

Before you build a compliance plan, you need to know where you stand against the 110 NIST 800-171 controls. A qualified assessor evaluates your current security posture and identifies every gap between where you are and where CMMC Level 2 requires you to be.

This isn't optional. Without a gap assessment, you're guessing. And guessing with CMMC means burning money on the wrong priorities while leaving real vulnerabilities open. If your [SPRS score](https://capital-cyber.com/capital-cyber-helping-with-sprs-score/) is based on a self-assessment you did in an afternoon, expect significant gaps.

### 2. Remediation: $30,000–$100,000+

This is where most of the budget goes. Remediation covers everything from implementing new security tools to upgrading infrastructure, developing policies, and configuring systems to meet specific requirements.

Common remediation costs include:
- Deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) across all systems
- Implementing a SIEM for continuous monitoring
- Encrypting CUI at rest and in transit
- Segmenting your network to isolate CUI environments
- Setting up multi-factor authentication everywhere
- Building out [the policy documentation](https://capital-cyber.com/cmmc-policies-the-boring-but-critical-docs-you-cant-ignore/) CMMC demands

The size of your CUI environment directly determines this number. Contractors who scope their CUI boundary tightly before remediating save tens of thousands.

### 3. Documentation: $10,000–$25,000

CMMC requires a System Security Plan (SSP), Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), and a library of security policies and procedures. Creating this documentation from scratch is a significant effort. Maintaining it is ongoing.

Many contractors underestimate this. Your C3PAO assessor will review every document line by line. Gaps in documentation fail assessments just as fast as technical vulnerabilities. Building a [compliance culture](https://capital-cyber.com/compliance-culture-its-not-just-for-hr-anymore/) early makes this sustainable instead of painful.

### 4. C3PAO Assessment: $20,000–$50,000

The actual CMMC assessment by a Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization has its own price tag. Assessment costs vary based on the complexity of your environment, the number of locations, and the C3PAO you choose.

This is the exam. Everything before this is preparation. Fail, and you're paying for reassessment plus whatever remediation you missed.

### 5. Ongoing Compliance: $10,000–$30,000/Year

CMMC isn't a one-time checkbox. You need continuous monitoring, regular vulnerability scanning, annual policy reviews, employee training, and documentation updates. Every year, forever, as long as you hold DoD contracts.

This is where many contractors get caught off guard. They budget for the sprint to certification and forget about the marathon that follows.

## Where Small Contractors Overspend

**Scope creep.** The single biggest cost driver is letting your CUI boundary expand across your entire network. Every system that touches CUI must meet all 110 controls. Define your [CUI environment](https://capital-cyber.com/cui-the-hot-potato-of-government-data/) tightly, segment it from the rest of your network, and your remediation costs drop dramatically.

**Doing it alone.** Contractors who try to manage compliance internally without experienced guidance often spend more in the long run. They implement controls incorrectly, buy tools they don't need, and fail assessments that cost money to retake.

**Ignoring flow-down requirements.** If you're a prime contractor, your [DFARS flow-down obligations](https://capital-cyber.com/dfars-flow-down-the-compliance-headache-you-cant-ignore/) mean your subcontractors need to comply too. Discovering this late in the process creates scrambles and delays.

## Where Small Contractors Can Save

**Leverage a managed security provider.** Instead of building an in-house security operations center, partner with a provider who already has the tools, staff, and processes in place. This converts a massive capital expense into a predictable monthly cost.

**Use enclave approaches.** Rather than upgrading your entire network, create a secure enclave specifically for CUI processing. This limits the scope of your assessment and reduces remediation costs significantly.

**Start early.** [CMMC Phase 1 is live](https://capital-cyber.com/the-cmmc-express-is-leaving-the-station-are-you-on-it/). Contractors who start now have time to spread costs over months instead of scrambling at contract renewal time.

## The Cost of Not Complying

Here's the math that matters: if you lose a single DoD contract because you can't demonstrate CMMC compliance, how much revenue is that? For most small defense contractors, one contract represents $500K to $5M+ in annual revenue.

CMMC compliance costs $75K–$200K. Losing contracts costs your business.

The contractors who are winning right now are the ones who started [building their compliance programs](https://capital-cyber.com/cmmc-2-0-key-insights-and-implementation-strategies/) before they were forced to. The ones who will struggle are those waiting until a contract clause makes it unavoidable.

## Get a Clear Picture of Your Costs

Every contractor's situation is different. Your cost depends on your current security posture, the size of your CUI environment, and how much of the work you can do internally.

We help defense contractors scope their CMMC compliance accurately, build realistic budgets, and implement the controls that actually matter. No guesswork, no inflated estimates, no surprises at assessment time.
