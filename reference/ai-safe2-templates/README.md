## What This Is

This folder contains the **AI SAFE² OpenClaw Core File Standard** 11 governance files that establish a complete, auditable, and security-hardened OpenClaw agent workspace from scratch.

These are not whitepapers. They are working files you copy, fill in the `<placeholders>`, and drop into your agent workspace. Each file is a ready-to-use template with detailed inline guidance and explicit AI SAFE² pillar mappings.

> **Start here if you are new:** Open [`OPENCLAW-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md`](./OPENCLAW-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md) and work through it top to bottom. It is an 8-step checklist that walks you from zero files to a fully authorized, smoke-tested agent.

## The 11 Files

### Identity & Soul Layer — *who the agent is and what it values*

| File | Loads When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`IDENTITY.md`](./IDENTITY.md) | Every request | 5-line identity anchor. Loaded first. Resists identity-replacement attacks. |
| [`SOUL.md`](./SOUL.md) | Every request | Agent constitution. Values, hard limits, and Love Equation alignment bands. |

### Operating Layer — *how the agent behaves*

| File | Loads When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) | Every request | Operating manual. Tool rules, skill security, data classification, AI SAFE² pillar map. |
| [`SUBAGENT-POLICY.md`](./SUBAGENT-POLICY.md) | Every request | Worker governance. Tiered trust levels, spawn protocol, context isolation. |
| [`MODEL-ROUTER.md`](./MODEL-ROUTER.md) | Every request | Multi-LLM routing policy. Tier 1/2/3, graceful degradation, cost controls. |
| [`HEARTBEAT.md`](./HEARTBEAT.md) | Heartbeat turns | Scheduled health checks. Per-cycle, daily, and weekly security monitoring. |

### Human & Environment Layer — *who the agent serves and where it lives*

| File | Loads When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`USER.md`](./USER.md) | Every request | Human identity contract. Trust delegation, data tiers, hard lines. |
| [`TOOLS.md`](./TOOLS.md) | Every request | Environment config only. Channel IDs, paths, secret locations means no instructions. |

### Memory Layer — *what the agent remembers*

| File | Loads When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`openclaw_memory.md`](./openclaw_memory.md) | Private sessions only | Memory governance protocol (v2.0). Write rules, injection defense, sub-agent isolation. |

### Workspace Layer — *how all agents in a workspace relate*

| File | Used By | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`OPENCLAW-WORKSPACE-POLICY.md`](./OPENCLAW-WORKSPACE-POLICY.md) | Workspace owner + all agents | Workspace constitution. Cross-agent trust, compliance mapping, incident response. |
| [`OPENCLAW-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md`](./OPENCLAW-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md) | Anyone creating a new agent | 8-step new agent checklist with mandatory smoke tests. |

## File Load Order

When an agent starts a session, it loads files in this order:

```
1. IDENTITY.md               ← Always. Every request. Before everything else.
2. SOUL.md                   ← Always. Values and hard limits.
3. AGENTS.md                 ← Always. Operating rules.
4. USER.md                   ← Always. Human context.
5. TOOLS.md                  ← Always. Environment lookup values.
6. MEMORY.md                 ← Private sessions only.
7. memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md      ← Private sessions. Today's log.
8. HEARTBEAT.md              ← Heartbeat turns only.
```

Sub-agents receive: task brief + relevant `SOUL.md` excerpts + `AGENTS.md` excerpts + task-specific context only. Never full `MEMORY.md`.

## How This Relates to the Existing OpenClaw Tools

This `core/` folder works alongside, not instead of the other AI SAFE² OpenClaw tools in the parent directory:

| Tool | What It Does | Relationship to Core Files |
|---|---|---|
| [`openclaw_memory.md`](../openclaw_memory.md) | Original v1 memory vaccine (security block list) | `core/openclaw_memory.md` is the v2.0 upgrade superset, no breaking changes |
| [`scanner.py`](../scanner.py) | Local vulnerability scanner, 0–100 risk score | Called during `HEARTBEAT.md` weekly security check |
| [`gateway/`](../gateway/) | Reverse proxy enforcing JSON schema, injection blocking, audit log | Referenced in `TOOLS.md` as mandatory; `MODEL-ROUTER.md` explains routing through it |

**The relationship:** The scanner and gateway are the external enforcement infrastructure. The core files are the agent's internal governance — the brain that decides what to do, while the gateway ensures nothing harmful leaves the system even if the brain is deceived.

## The Alignment Foundation: Love Equation

`SOUL.md` is grounded in Brian Roemmele's Love Equation as an operational alignment system:

```
dE/dt = β(C − D)E
```

Where **C** = cooperation (truth, privacy, autonomy support) and **D** = defection (deception, manipulation, harm). When C exceeds D, alignment grows. When D exceeds C, the system decays.

This produces three alignment bands the agent evaluates on every response:

| Band | Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | C − D > 0.3 | Full autonomy. Proceed. |
| 🟡 Yellow | 0.0 < C − D ≤ 0.3 | Proceed with explicit transparency. Flag uncertainty. |
| 🔴 Red | C − D ≤ 0 | Stop. Explain. Require human approval. |

Alignment is a mathematical property of behavior, not a policy layer.

## AI SAFE² Five-Pillar Mapping

Every file in this standard maps to at least one AI SAFE² pillar:

| Pillar | Files |
|---|---|
| **S — Sanitize & Isolate** | `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md` (skill security), `SUBAGENT-POLICY.md`, `openclaw_memory.md` (injection defense) |
| **A — Audit & Inventory** | `USER.md` (data classification), `TOOLS.md` (config audit), `SUBAGENT-POLICY.md` (spawn logging), `OPENCLAW-WORKSPACE-POLICY.md` (agent registry) |
| **F — Fail-Safe & Recovery** | `SOUL.md` (Red band protocol), `AGENTS.md` (confirmation gates), `MODEL-ROUTER.md` (graceful degradation), `SUBAGENT-POLICY.md` (failure handling) |
| **E — Engage & Monitor** | `HEARTBEAT.md` (scheduled monitoring), `openclaw_memory.md` (alignment drift tracking), `MODEL-ROUTER.md` (cost alerts) |
| **E — Evolve & Educate** | `OPENCLAW-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md` (smoke tests), `OPENCLAW-WORKSPACE-POLICY.md` (quarterly review), all files (PR-gated change control) |

---

## Compliance Coverage

The workspace policy and soul files together support alignment with:

**ISO 42001** · **NIST AI RMF** · **SOC 2 Type II** · **GDPR** · **HIPAA**

See [`OPENCLAW-WORKSPACE-POLICY.md`](./OPENCLAW-WORKSPACE-POLICY.md) Section 8 for the full compliance mapping table.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy the core files into your agent workspace root
cp -r examples/openclaw/core/. ~/my-agent/

# 2. Open the template and follow it
# Start here:
open OPENCLAW-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md

# 3. Fill placeholders in this order:
#    IDENTITY.md → SOUL.md → AGENTS.md → USER.md → TOOLS.md

# 4. Run the smoke test (Step 6 in the template)
# 5. Register the agent (Step 7)
# 6. You're authorized.
```

## What's NOT Here (Premium Tier)

This folder covers single-agent workspaces. Swarm governance: multi-agent fleets with collective alignment scoring, trust graphs, quorum memory writes, and cascade failure playbooks, is the premium tier, currently in design.

If you're running more than one agent and need them to collaborate with enforced governance, [watch the repository](https://github.com/CyberStrategyInstitute/ai-safe2-framework) or check [cyberstrategyinstitute.com/AI-Safe2/](https://cyberstrategyinstitute.com/AI-Safe2/) for swarm tier availability.
