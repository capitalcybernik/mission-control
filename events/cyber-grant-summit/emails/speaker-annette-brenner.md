Hi Annette,

Quick check-in on the **Cyber Grant Summit** — April 28th, 12:00–1:30 PM ET.

**First: Does this date/time still work for you?** Want to confirm no conflicts before we lock in the final agenda.

**Your Speaking Topic:** Based on our research, here's what we think lands best with this audience:

> **"Real Funding for Real Manufacturers: How NY Firms Are Getting CMMC Grants"**
>
> A 15-minute breakdown of actual grants available to NY manufacturers (not theoretical — real programs with real dollars), eligibility requirements, and how NextCorps helps firms navigate the application process. Include 1–2 quick success stories if you have them.

**Partnership Ask:**

Can you share the event with your list? We're targeting manufacturing firms in NY who need CMMC compliance but don't know grants exist. Your audience is exactly who we want in the room.

If yes, I'll send you:
- Event graphic + copy for your newsletter/social
- Direct registration link
- One-pager on why this matters to manufacturers

**Who else should we talk to?**

Any other MEPs, manufacturing associations, or industry groups you'd recommend we reach out to for co-promotion? We're building a partner list and your network would be gold.

Let me know on the date/time confirmation and the partnership piece. Happy to jump on a quick call if easier.

Thanks Annette — looking forward to having you on the summit.

Best,

**P.S.** — If you have any specific grants or programs you want to highlight in your talk, send them over and I'll make sure we tee them up in the intro.
