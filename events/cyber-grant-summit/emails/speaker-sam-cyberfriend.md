Hi Sam,

I'm putting together the **Cyber Grant Summit** — an online event on **April 28th, 12:00–1:30 PM ET** — and I'd love to have you speak.

**The Event:**

We're bringing together manufacturing and construction firms who need CMMC compliance but think they can't afford it. The whole point: **Grant funding exists, and they don't have to do it alone.**

**Why You:**

You work with SMBs nationwide as a vCISO. You know what "security on a budget" actually looks like. You speak the language of business owners who need CMMC but don't have enterprise security budgets.

**Suggested Topic:**

> **"CMMC on a Budget: A vCISO's Playbook for Small Defense Contractors"**
>
> 15 minutes on practical, cost-effective approaches to CMMC compliance. What to prioritize, what you can defer, where grants fit in, and how lean teams get audit-ready without breaking the bank.

**Two Questions:**

1. **Does April 28, 12:00–1:30 PM ET work for you?**

2. **Can you share this with your network?** Your SMB clients and contacts are exactly who we're trying to reach — businesses that need CMMC but think it's out of reach. If you're willing to promote, I'll send you:
   - Ready-to-send email copy
   - Social graphics
   - Registration link

**Who else should we talk to?**

Any other vCISOs, MSPs, or SMB-focused security consultants we should bring in for promotion? Building a partner ecosystem around this event.

Let me know on availability and I'll lock in your spot. Happy to hop on a 10-minute call to discuss angles if helpful.

Thanks Sam — your "no jargon, just results" approach is exactly what this audience needs to hear.

Best,

**P.S.** — If you have any budget frameworks, CMMC roadmaps, or resources you've developed for SMB clients, this would be a great place to share them. We can drive downloads/signups back to your site.
