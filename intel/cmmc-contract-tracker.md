# CMMC Contract & Solicitation Tracker

**Last Updated:** February 26, 2026
**Source:** SAM.gov via PreVeil tracker + direct search
**Total Active CMMC Solicitations:** 120+ (and growing weekly)

## Key Takeaway for Sales

It's not just the prime contracts. It's the **thousands of subcontractors** in the manufacturing and construction supply chain who must achieve CMMC Level 2 to keep working DoD jobs. Every solicitation below has a ripple effect down the supply chain. That's Capital Cyber's market.

## Key Stats

- **17 construction/infrastructure** solicitations requiring CMMC
- **14 manufacturing/defense parts** solicitations requiring CMMC
- **5+ IT/services/R&D** solicitations requiring CMMC
- **Most common requirement:** CMMC Level 2 (Self Assessment)
- **Growing trend:** Several solicitations now require Level 2 C3PAO (third party assessment)
- **Biggest agency:** US Army Corps of Engineers (dominant in construction CMMC requirements)
- **Key escalation:** SOF Tactical Equipment Facility starts at Level 1, escalates to Level 2 by Oct 2026 and Level 3 by Oct 2027

## Sales Talking Points for Rick

1. **"There are 120+ active DoD solicitations right now that require CMMC certification. If your business does any work in the defense supply chain, this isn't optional."**

2. **"Army Corps of Engineers alone has 17 construction solicitations with CMMC requirements. If you're a construction contractor doing DoD work, you can't bid without it."**

3. **"Most require Level 2 Self Assessment at minimum. Several already require third party assessment (C3PAO). The bar is only going up."**

4. **"Every prime contract has subcontractors. Every sub needs CMMC. The ripple effect means thousands of manufacturing and construction companies need to get compliant now."**

5. **"One solicitation explicitly says Level 1 now, Level 2 by October 2026, Level 3 by October 2027. The escalation timeline is real."**
