## Security Audit - Sensitive Files Remediated (00:00 UTC)

Daily security audit flagged sensitive files tracked in git:
- `.dart-config` (Dart API token)
- `gmail-api/token.json` (OAuth token)  
- `gmail-api/exchange-token.js` (token exchange script)

**Action taken:** Removed from git tracking, added to .gitignore, committed and pushed. Files remain locally.

**Mitigating factor:** Repo is private. No public exposure.

**Still in git history:** The tokens are still in old commits. Full cleanup would require BFG repo-cleaner or rotating the tokens. Recommend rotating the Dart API token and Gmail OAuth token as a precaution.

**Other findings (low risk):**
- Credential pattern in MEMORY.md (expected, contains API references)
- .env file at /root/.openclaw/.env (OpenClaw's own config, not in repo)
- node_modules references (false positives, not tracked)
- "password-cracking" files are marketing content, not actual credentials
