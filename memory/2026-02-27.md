## Security Audit - Sensitive Files Remediated (00:00 UTC)

Daily security audit flagged sensitive files tracked in git:
- `.dart-config` (Dart API token)
- `gmail-api/token.json` (OAuth token)  
- `gmail-api/exchange-token.js` (token exchange script)

**Action taken:** Removed from git tracking, added to .gitignore, committed and pushed. Files remain locally.

**Mitigating factor:** Repo is private. No public exposure.

**Still in git history:** The tokens are still in old commits. Full cleanup would require BFG repo-cleaner or rotating the tokens. Recommend rotating the Dart API token and Gmail OAuth token as a precaution.

**Other findings (low risk):**
- Credential pattern in MEMORY.md (expected, contains API references)
- .env file at /root/.openclaw/.env (OpenClaw's own config, not in repo)
- node_modules references (false positives, not tracked)
- "password-cracking" files are marketing content, not actual credentials

## Capital Cyber Work Session (Feb 26-27, 2026)

### Newsletter v3 Humanized Style Approved
- Nikhil approved the v3 humanized newsletter format: Georgia serif font, no gradients, no colored boxes, signed as Nikhil personally, simple text link CTAs
- This is the standard going forward for all email marketing

### 20 Marketing Emails Built
- Created full series of 20 marketing emails in `marketing-emails/` directory
- Topics: AI Recall, NDR, Ransomware, SOC, App Whitelisting, Web Filter, Firewall, MFA, Security Training, Email Security, Backup/DR, Patch Mgmt, Mobile Device, Dark Web, Insurance Readiness, EDR, CMMC, Pen Testing, Incident Response, CISA Collapse
- All use v3 humanized style, all have CGA P.S. sponsor line at bottom
- Added to Mission Control dashboard (capitalcybernik.github.io/mission-control) under Marketing tab
- Twice weekly send schedule (Tue/Thu) over 10 weeks
- Nikhil wants to review them on Mission Control, not via email

### CMMC Contract Tracker Built
- Pulled 120+ active CMMC solicitations from SAM.gov via PreVeil tracker
- 17 construction, 14 manufacturing solicitations catalogued with dates, agencies, CMMC levels, SAM.gov links
- Added to Mission Control as dedicated CMMC Tracker tab
- Also saved as `intel/cmmc-contract-tracker.md`
- **To-do: Get SAM.gov API key for automated daily updates**

### 4 CMMC Pages Published to capital-cyber.com
- WordPress access obtained (user: aresautomation, app password stored)
- Published but content didn't render properly (CSS/style blocks stripped by WP theme)
- **Spawned agent to fix: rebuild with inline styles, verify before reporting**
- Pages:
  - capital-cyber.com/cmmc-contract-tracker/
  - capital-cyber.com/cmmc-for-construction-companies/
  - capital-cyber.com/cmmc-for-manufacturers/
  - capital-cyber.com/cmmc-contracts-requiring-certification-2026/ (blog post)

### CMMC Ready Now vs CGA
- On CMMC-related pages, use CMMC Ready Now (cmmcreadynow.com) NOT CGA/Cyber Grants Alliance
- CMMC Ready Now is a standalone SaaS product, NOT included with Capital Cyber packages
- CGA grants mention stays on non-CMMC content (marketing emails, general pages)

### Insurability as a Service Landing Page
- Built full HTML landing page for Fast-Track to Insurability product
- Covers Big 5 controls, Broker Partner Program, FAQ, pricing approach
- Sent to Nikhil for review, not yet published to WP
- File: `drafts/insurability-landing-page.html`

### Website Dental/DSO Cleanup Needed
- Feedback: capital-cyber.com has too much dental/DSO language
- Outlined 8 specific changes needed (hero, industry list, "We Can Help" cards, etc.)
- New priority order: CMMC/Gov Contractors → Manufacturing/Construction → CPAs → Everyone else
- Don't delete dental pages, just remove from prominence

### First SEO Lead: Bill Unger
- CFO of Construction On All Levels, LLC (Eleanor, WV)
- Industrial construction and mining, 10-30+ employees
- Zero cybersecurity, been hacked before, no budget set
- Found Capital Cyber via Google search (SEO working!)
- Rick calling Friday Feb 28 at 3 PM EST
- Drafted and sent follow-up email (v2 with mobile device protection)
- **Not yet added to GHL**

### GHL Access Obtained
- API: v1 REST API working (Bearer token)
- 4,881 contacts in system
- **Rule: DO NOT send emails from GHL**
- Draft everything, send to Nikhil for forwarding

### Client Emails Drafted
- Dr. T: Windows 10 end of life, HIPAA + insurance risk, work with their IT company
- Pamela: Same issue, one computer, dental office
- Craftsman Auto Care Sterling: Starlink backup internet research + client email

### Starlink Research
- Best option for business backup: $50/mo residential + $349 dish
- Works natively with WatchGuard (Multi-WAN failover) and UniFi (WAN2 failover)
- Craftsman Auto Care, 21180 Potomac View Rd, Sterling, VA 20165 having internet issues

### Mission Control Dashboard
- Correct URL: capitalcybernik.github.io/mission-control (NOT eos2.capital-cyber.com)
- Added Marketing tab and CMMC Tracker tab
- Rick will get access to review

### CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED
- **Always verify published content renders correctly before reporting to Nikhil**
- Added to IDENTITY.md as operational standard
- Spin up verification agent if needed
- Nikhil should NEVER have to proof my work

### WordPress Access
- User: aresautomation (has create/edit permissions)
- App password: stored (the "nikhil" user has read-only REST API access)
- Must include User-Agent header to bypass Cloudflare
