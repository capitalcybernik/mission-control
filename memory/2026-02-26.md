## Security Channel Setup
- Nikhil set up #security-and-training channel on Discord for building OpenClaw use cases
- Five properties confirmed: Capital-Cyber.com, CyberGrantsAlliance.org, CMMCReadyNow.com, TelcoUnited.com, GetNextLevelMarketing.com
- GetNextLevelMarketing.com is the **marketing division** (new info)
- Reviewed Scoble/BlevLabs OpenClaw Intelligence Report (98 use cases)
- Mapped relevant use cases to all 5 properties
- Nikhil approved adding to mission control, will tackle in ~1 week

## Top 5 Use Cases to Build
1. Content Pipeline for all 5 brands
2. CRM automation via GoHighLevel API (CGA grants + Capital Cyber leads)
3. CMMC regulatory monitor (daily DoD/NIST update scanning)
4. Client onboarding automation (Capital Cyber + CGA)
5. SEO monitoring dashboard (all 5 domains, weekly reports)

## Git History Cleanup (completed earlier)
- Purged Gmail OAuth credentials, tokens, node_modules from git history
- Removed TOOLS.md from git tracking
- Updated .gitignore
- Daily self-backup cron job active (midnight EST)

## LinkedIn OAuth Connected (Feb 24, carried forward)
- Authenticated as Casey O Connor (support@telcounited.com)
- Person URN: urn:li:person:1DdST2JDNl
- Token good for ~60 days (expires ~April 25)
- Scopes: profile, email, w_member_social (personal posting only)
- Community Management API needed for org pages (Capital Cyber, CMMC Ready Now, CGA)
- Nikhil could not request Community Management API on current app, may need different LinkedIn account

## Social Media Operation Fully Built
- 3 brands × 3 platforms = 10 accounts tracked on Mission Control Social tab
- Brands: Capital Cyber, CMMC Ready Now, Cyber Grants Alliance
- Platforms: LinkedIn, Facebook, X/Twitter
- Casey's personal LinkedIn is the only connected account currently
- Posting schedules set but crons paused per Nikhil (handling via social media Discord channel instead)
- Content guidelines burned in: short, no jargon, no fear mongering, CGA mention Wednesdays

## ClawHub Skills Installed (11 of 13)
- self-improving-agent, security-auditor, agent-security-monitor, email-marketing
- email-daily-summary, cyber-security-engineer, openclaw-social-scheduler
- marketing-mode, linkedin-lead-generation, ai-meeting-notes, openai-whisper-api
- SKIPPED: x-post-automation, linkedin-api (not needed, using social media channel instead)

## Mission Control Dashboard Upgrades

## 6 Implementation Projects Queued

5. Social Media Research (LOW/PARKED)
6. YouTube Analytics (LOW/PARKED)
- Nikhil wants to do these together as discussions, knock them out in ~1 week

## Key Decisions
- No dashes (— or -) in any written output (burned into SOUL.md)
- Always respond to Nikhil, no exceptions (burned into AGENTS.md)
- Don't restructure agents, keep single Ares agent across all channels
- Retry failed tasks max 5 times then stop and create a task for joint resolution
- Clawdiverse.com saved as reference for OpenClaw use cases

## Intel Highlights

- Non-human identities outnumber humans 82:1 in enterprise
