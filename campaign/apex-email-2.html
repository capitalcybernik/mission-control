<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I wanted to follow up on my note from last week about a potential partnership between the Cyber Grants Alliance and APEX Accelerators.</p>

<p>To be direct, there is a gap in the defense industrial base that both our organizations are positioned to close. APEX Accelerators helps businesses win government contracts. The Cyber Grants Alliance helps those businesses secure the data they will handle under those contracts. Without proper cybersecurity, a contract won can quickly become a contract lost, not to mention the risk to national security.</p>

<p>This is not theoretical. The FBI launched Operation Winter SHIELD in January 2026, a national campaign warning that small and medium businesses now represent 43 percent of all cyberattack targets. For defense contractors, the stakes are even higher. A single breach can mean lost clearance, terminated contracts, and in some cases, criminal liability under the FTC Safeguards Rule.</p>

<p>What we are proposing is simple: APEX Accelerators introduces eligible businesses in your pipeline to the Cyber Grants Alliance for cybersecurity grants covering CMMC gap assessments, NIST compliance, and WISP development. We handle the security, you keep them competitive. It strengthens the businesses you support and protects the supply chain we both serve.</p>

<p>I believe a 15 minute call would be enough to determine if this partnership makes sense. If the timing is not right, I understand, but I would regret not making the connection given how aligned our missions are.</p>

<p>Are you available this week or next?</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>
