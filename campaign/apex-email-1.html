<p>Hello,</p>

<p>My name is Nikhil, and I serve on the board of the Cyber Grants Alliance, a nonprofit organization with a mission to protect the nation by bridging the cybersecurity divide.</p>

<p>I have been following the work of APEX Accelerators and the critical role you play in strengthening our defense industrial base. With more than 300 offices helping businesses navigate government contracting, you are uniquely positioned at the front door of companies entering the defense supply chain.</p>

<p>There is a natural alignment between our organizations. Just as APEX Accelerators help businesses become competitive for government contracts, the Cyber Grants Alliance helps those same businesses protect the sensitive data they will soon be entrusted with through cybersecurity grants and compliance support.</p>

<p>As you know, CMMC compliance and the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information are now central to winning and keeping defense contracts. Yet many of the small businesses in your pipeline lack the resources to implement proper cybersecurity controls or complete a Written Information Security Program. This is where we can help.</p>

<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how a partnership between the Cyber Grants Alliance and APEX Accelerators could protect the Defense Industrial Base from cyber threats while supporting the businesses in your network. It is a conversation about shared mission and mutual impact.</p>

<p>Would you be available for a brief call next week?</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>
