## What It Is

Project Spectrum is the DoD's official cybersecurity resource platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). Its mission is to improve cybersecurity readiness, resiliency, and compliance across the DIB and federal manufacturing supply chain.

The DoD promotes Project Spectrum as its preferred partner for SMBs looking for CMMC compliance resources and general cybersecurity guidance.

## What It Offers

### 1. On-Demand Training Courses
- Video-based courses (~1 hour each) covering:
  - Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) identification
  - System Security Plans (SSPs)
  - Plans of Action & Milestones (POA&Ms)
  - Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI)
- "Bits & Bytes": Short training courses addressing individual CMMC Level 1 controls
- Content is introductory/high-level; contractors may need more detailed guidance for actual implementation

### 2. Cyber Readiness Checks (Self-Assessment Tools)
- Manual checklists for self-assessing against:
  - NIST SP 800-171
  - CMMC Level 1
  - CMMC Level 2
- Assesses against NIST SP 800-171A assessment objectives (the correct approach)
- NIST 800-171 checklist shows SPRS score; CMMC Level 2 shows percent met
- Includes "tooltips" (generic control interpretations) and short video summaries
- **Note:** CMMC Level 2 and NIST 800-171 checklists are functionally identical since Level 2 aligns with 800-171

### 3. Events & Webinars
- Webinars on small business cybersecurity and CMMC topics
- Guest speakers from NSA, Cyber AB, and other organizations
- Also advertises external events (DoD contracting workshops, etc.)
- Frequency: approximately 2 webinars per year (historically)

### 4. Mentor-Protégé Program (MPP) Pilot
- Pairs larger DoD contractor "Mentors" with small business "Protégés"
- Focused on assisting with NIST SP 800-171 implementation and CMMC prep
- Preferred resource for USAF MPP small business Protégés
- **Status:** Under reassessment following CMMC 2.0 changes

### 5. Info Hub
- Blogs, white papers, video tips, and policy publications
- Blog series covering all CMMC Level 1 controls
- "Cyber Advisors" write white papers on various cybersecurity topics
- Policy Corner with government CMMC-related publications

### 6. Partner Programs
- Partnerships with: CMMC program, Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEP), Small Business Administration (SBA)

## Strengths

1. **Free and official:** Backed by DoD, no vendor bias
2. **Self-assessment tools use 800-171A objectives:** Correct methodology for CMMC prep
3. **Good introductory resource:** Solid starting point for SMBs new to CMMC
4. **Covers the basics:** CUI identification, SSP, POA&M fundamentals

## Limitations (Important for Capital Cyber Positioning)

1. **High-level only:** Training and blogs introduce concepts but lack implementation depth. Contractors may think CMMC requires less than it actually does.
2. **Content gaps:** Some control explanations miss critical details (e.g., processes acting on behalf of authorized users, vulnerability scanning for flaw remediation)
3. **Outdated content:** Some video tips still reference CMMC 1.0 naming schema; MPP Pilot page not updated since CMMC 2.0 announcement
4. **No hands-on support:** Cannot help with actual implementation, remediation, or C3PAO prep
5. **No SSP/POA&M creation:** Explains what they are but doesn't help build them
6. **No environment-specific guidance:** Generic advice that contractors struggle to apply to their specific IT environments

## Capital Cyber Opportunity

Project Spectrum is a good resource to RECOMMEND to prospects and clients as supplementary education. But its limitations are exactly where Capital Cyber fills the gap:

- Project Spectrum explains what controls are → **Capital Cyber implements them**
- Project Spectrum provides a self-assessment checklist → **Capital Cyber conducts a professional gap assessment**
- Project Spectrum introduces SSPs → **Capital Cyber writes and maintains them**
- Project Spectrum identifies what CMMC requires → **Capital Cyber gets you through the C3PAO assessment**

Positioning: "Start with Project Spectrum to understand the basics. Come to Capital Cyber when you're ready to actually get certified."

This is a natural lead-in for content marketing: write blog posts that go DEEPER than Project Spectrum on specific controls, reference PS as a starting point, and position Capital Cyber as the next step.
